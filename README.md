# Claude Code R Skills

*Last updated: 2026-02-20*

A curated collection of Claude Code configurations for modern R use. These skills, rules, commands, and agents help Claude Code understand R best practices and generate idiomatic, high-quality R code. Additionally the rules and commands help with efficient token usage and enforce constraints, and agents can perform specific tasks. Obviously you can fork and adapt any of these to your case-use.

I use Positron, but if you are a VSCode user there is also a plugin for R language server for code intelligence.

## Overview

This repository provides Claude Code configurations specifically for R users, combining:

-   **R-specific skills** for modern tidyverse patterns, rlang, performance, OOP, and more
-   **Development workflow tools** adapted from [everything-claude-code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code)
-   **Testing and quality rules** for R development

## Understanding Feature Types

Claude Code uses five types of features to customise its behaviour for R development. Each serves a distinct purpose in the development workflow.

### Skills

**What they are:** Markdown documents containing domain knowledge, best practices, and coding patterns that Claude references when writing code. Skills are passive knowledge resources loaded into Claude's context when relevant.

**When to use:** Claude automatically activates skills based on the code you're working on. For example, when you're writing tidyverse code, the `tidyverse-patterns` skill provides guidance on modern pipes, joins, and grouping.

**How they work:** Skills live in `.claude/skills/` and contain detailed guidance, anti-patterns to avoid, and code examples. Claude consults these when making implementation decisions.

**How to use:**

``` bash
# Skills are automatically activated - no manual invocation needed
# You can also explicitly request skill usage in your prompts:
"Write a function using tidyverse-patterns to summarize data by group"
```

### Commands

**What they are:** User-invocable shortcuts (prefixed with `/`) that trigger specific workflows or behaviours. Commands are active - you call them explicitly to perform actions.

**When to use:** Use commands when you want Claude to follow a specific workflow, such as planning before implementation (`/plan`) or conducting a code review (`/code-review`).

**How they work:** Commands are defined in the `commands/` directory and can trigger agents, enforce specific behaviours, or structure Claude's responses in particular ways.

**How to use:**

``` bash
# In your Claude Code conversation:
/plan Add bootstrap confidence intervals to model output

# After seeing the plan, respond:
yes  # or "proceed" to start implementation

# Review code before committing:
/code-review
```

### Rules

**What they are:** Mandatory constraints and requirements that Claude must follow. Rules enforce project standards like test coverage thresholds, security practices, and git workflows.

**When to use:** Rules are always active - Claude automatically enforces them throughout the session. They're particularly important for maintaining code quality, security, and testing standards.

**How they work:** Rules are markdown files in the `rules/` directory that define requirements (e.g., "80% test coverage required") and constraints (e.g., "never commit credentials"). Claude validates actions against these rules.

**How to use:**

``` bash
# Rules are automatically enforced - no manual invocation needed
# Claude will:
# - Require 80% test coverage (from testing.md)
# - Validate credential handling (from security.md)
# - Format commits correctly (from git-workflow.md)

# You can reference rules explicitly:
"Make sure this follows our testing rules"
```

### Agents

**What they are:** Specialized sub-agents with specific roles, expertise, and limited tool access. Agents are focused workers that handle particular types of tasks.

**When to use:** Agents are invoked by commands or automatically by Claude when specialised expertise is needed. The `planner` agent creates implementation plans, while the `code-reviewer` agent analyses code for issues.

**How they work:** Agents are defined in the `agents/` directory with specific tools and prompts. They receive a task, complete it with their specialised knowledge, and return results to the main conversation.

**How to use:**

``` bash
# Agents are typically invoked via commands:
/plan Feature description      # Activates the planner agent
/code-review                   # Activates the code-reviewer agent

# Claude may also invoke agents automatically when appropriate
```

### Hooks

**What they are:** Event-driven JavaScript scripts that execute automatically at specific points in Claude's workflow (e.g., before editing files, on session start/end, before context compaction).

**When to use:** Hooks run automatically in response to events - you don't invoke them directly. They're useful for context management, state persistence, and workflow optimisations.

**How they work:** Hooks are configured in `.claude/hooks/hooks.json` with matchers that define when they trigger. Scripts execute and can modify Claude's behaviour or provide additional context.

**How to use:**

``` bash
# Hooks run automatically. Configured hooks in this repo:
# - suggest-compact: Suggests /compact after 50 tool uses
# - pre-compact: Saves session state before compaction
# - session-start: Reports available history on startup
# - session-end: Persists session state for continuity
# - doc-blocker: Warns about creating random .md files
# - git-push-warning: Warns before any git push

# Hooks are transparent - you'll see their output in the session:
[Hook] Context window usage: 45/50 tool calls. Consider /compact soon.
[Hook] WARNING: About to run: git push origin main
[Hook] Confirm this push is intentional before proceeding.
```

### Contexts

**What they are:** Mode-switching markdown files that adjust Claude's behaviour for different phases of work — coding, exploring, or reviewing.

**When to use:** Reference a context file when you want to shift Claude's focus. Use `dev` when writing code, `research` when exploring unfamiliar territory, and `review` when auditing changes.

**How they work:** Context files live in `contexts/` and contain behavioural instructions, tool priorities, and checklists. Reference them with `@contexts/dev.md` in your conversation or CLAUDE.md.

**How to use:**

``` bash
# Switch to focused coding mode:
@contexts/dev.md

# Switch to thorough exploration mode:
@contexts/research.md

# Switch to quality review mode:
@contexts/review.md
```

**Recommended workflow sequence:**

```
research → plan → tdd → dev → verify → review → commit
```

## Quick Reference

### Essential Modern R Patterns

``` r
# Always use native pipe
data |>
  filter(x > 0) |>
  summarise(mean(y))

# Modern joins with join_by()
inner_join(x, y, by = join_by(a == b))

# Per-operation grouping with .by
summarise(data, mean(value), .by = category)

# Embrace for function arguments
my_func <- function(data, var) {
  data |> summarise(mean = mean({{ var }}))
}

# Type-stable iteration
map_dbl(data, mean)  # Not sapply()
```

### Key Anti-Patterns to Avoid

``` r
# Avoid legacy magrittr pipe
data %>% filter(x > 0)  # Use |> instead

# Avoid old join syntax
by = c("a" = "b")  # Use join_by(a == b)

# Avoid group_by/ungroup
group_by(x) |> summarise(y) |> ungroup()  # Use .by instead

# Avoid sapply (type-unstable)
sapply(x, f)  # Use map_*() instead
```

Note: `r-machine-learning` skill is local-only and not included in the public repository. Updated 2026-02-20 based on the WARND competition final model (4-model ridge stacked ensemble: XGBoost, Elastic Net, CatBoost, ExtraTrees; OOF AUC 0.8187). Key additions: Elastic Net and ExtraTrees patterns, stratified participant-level CV, expanded temporal feature engineering, ridge meta-learner stacking, and model selection guidance including documented TabNet failure.

## Core Principles

1.  **Use modern tidyverse patterns** - dplyr 1.1+, native pipe, current APIs
2.  **Profile before optimising** - Use profvis and bench
3.  **Write readable code first** - Optimize only when necessary
4.  **Follow tidyverse style guide** - Consistent naming and structure
5.  **Test-driven development** - Write tests before implementation
6.  **80% minimum coverage** - Comprehensive testing required

## Recommended Workflow

For any non-trivial feature or fix, follow this sequence:

``` text
@contexts/research.md   # Explore before acting
/plan                   # Design the approach (uses Opus)
@contexts/dev.md        # Switch to coding mode
/tdd                    # Write tests first (RED)
                        # Implement (GREEN → REFACTOR)
/verify                 # Full quality gate before committing
@contexts/review.md     # Final review if needed
```

## Requirements

-   R 4.3+ (for native pipe `|>`)
-   dplyr 1.1+ (for `.by`, `join_by()`, `reframe()`)
-   purrr 1.0+ (for `list_rbind()`)
-   tidyr 1.3+ (for `separate_wider_*()`)
-   testthat 3.0+ (for snapshot testing)

## Environment Management

-   **R packages**: Use `pak` for installation
-   **R environments**: Use `renv` for project isolation
-   **Python**: Use `uv` for Python environments (if needed)
